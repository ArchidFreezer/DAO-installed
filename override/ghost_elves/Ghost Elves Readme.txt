GHOST ELVES MOD
By Mintflavoredwindows

This mod changes the models of two of the Elvish-speaking ghost boy and his mother in the Brecilian Ruins from humans to elves,
in keeping with the toolset's description of the boy as elven.

INSTALLATION
To use this mod, extract the files from the "Ghost Elves.zip" folder and place the non-readme files
in the override folder found at:
~\Documents\Bioware\Dragon Age\packages\core\override
This mod is not compatible with other mods that require those files to be overridden or change the appearance of the ghost boy
and his mother.

UNINSTALLATION
Remove "73254_shade_first_line.cub," "73254_shade_first_line.cut," "ef_ntb330_shadeelf.mor," "kn_ntb330_gboy.mor,"
and "ntb330cr_shade.utc" from the override folder.

Enjoy!
