A Priest! Not A Mage!


Fixes Bioware's mistake where they mislabel a priest as a mage
.

Unzip the "A Priest! Not A Mage!" directory to your override directory. ie: "My Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\packages\core\override"


Will not work if you have other mods that modify this file: cir330cr_priest_2.utc
