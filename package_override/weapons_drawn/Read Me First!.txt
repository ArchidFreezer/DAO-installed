This mod lets you cast all spells with your weapons drawn with the exception of Power of Blood spells.

Installation:

- Overwrite the GDA files of Cone of Cold, Winter's Grasp, Haste, and Power of Blood spells from the Dain's Fixes with the ones found in this folder
  - Add abi_coneofcold.gda is added to Dain's Fixes\Dain's Fixes\Bug Fixes\Cone of Cold
  - Add abi_rangedaim.gda is added to Dain's Fixes\Dain's Fixes\Bug Fixes\Ranged aim speed
  - Add abi_powerofblood.gda is added to Dain's Fixes\Dain's Fixes\Bug Fixes\Power of Blood
  - Add abi_wintersgrasp.gda is added to Dain's Fixes\Dain's Fixes\Tweaks\Winter's Grasp freeze
- Add the remaining file 'ABI_weaponsdrawn.GDA' to Documents\Bioware\Dragon Age\packages\core\override

Compatibitity: I've only checked compatibility with Dain's Fixes and nothing else. If you have GDA files coming from other mods then check if they affect the spells listed below:

FLAME_BLAST
FIREBALL
REJUVINATION
HEROIC_DEFENSE
HEROIC_OFFENSE
ANTIMAGIC_BURST
DEATH_HEX
PARALYZE
HORROR
WAKING_NIGHTMARE
MASS_PARALYSIS
VULNERABILITY_HEX
SLEEP
STONEFIST
WALKING_BOMB
MIND_BLAST
BLIZZARD
SHOCK
LIGHTNING
DRAIN_LIFE
AFFLICTION_HEX

These are the spells that force weapons to be sheathed and these are the only ones modified by my GDA(plus Winter's Grasp, Cone of Cold, Haste and Dark Sustenance)
