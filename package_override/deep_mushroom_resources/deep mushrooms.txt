Install in the override.  Can be installed/uninstalled at any time. 
This mod adds lootable deep mushrooms throughout the game, mostly in underground areas, but a few are above ground where they might make at 
least a little bit of sense. ;)

The default model is ported from DAI; an apparently unused "ghoul mushroom" model, since that most closely resembles the DAO icon.  I've also 
included the spider-parasitizing version used in DAI as an alternate.  Overwrite the files in the main 'Deep Mushroom Resources' folder with 
the ones from the 'Alternate Model' folder if you want to use them (or make sure the alternate folder loads after).  The alternate folder also 
contains an icon replacement to match the new model; if you don't want it, delete "gen_im_cft_reg_mushroom.uti" and "rgt_ico_deepmush_dai.dds".  


Shouldn't conflict with anything, really, since the additions were done via scripting for maximum compatibility.

There are two areas that may not have any deep mushrooms the first time you enter them, depending on where you entered from and if you 
installed mid-game (thanks to the weirdness of area lists): the Frostback Mountain Pass, and the Darkspawn Tunnels underneath the Tower of Ishal.  
Doing a quick save/reload will make the mushrooms appear.  :)
