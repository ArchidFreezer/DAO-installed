Instead of dumping all DLC and promo items in the player's inventory or Bodahn's shop, this mod distributes them throughout the game in lore appropriate spots, adding around 60 new items to the looting experience. This includes a rebalance of the Feastday Gifts to be similar to other gifts.

This mod has similar functionality to darthbdaman's when importing to Awakening. If you have any of the items in your inventory that have Awakening versions, they are automatically replaced.
You can also use the command give_awakening_dlc to receive all.
I would strongly recommend silencer711's DLC Transfer To Awakening Patch (Updated) to transfer all Origins DLC to Awakening.
