# DAO-installed

This repository is the contents of the packages/core/override folder of a Dragon Age: Origins installation.

The mods installed are strongly based on the list from Sintar Gaming here: https://www.sinitargaming.com/dao.html
I have done away with all dazip installs, instead I extract the dazip contents into loose files, create a new folder in override and add the loose files there. This makes it easier to test for file copnflictrs and also keeps everything in one place.

I do not include all the mods from the guide and add soem additional ones that I like, but the core of my installation is from the website. The commit history includes all the mods that I have installed, plus the URL where they were sourced from for accreditation.

Large Files - Due to the github limitaion of file sizes in free repositories it is not possible for the following mods to commit and pushed, these are inclided in my mod, but not in git:
Dragon Age BIK Improvement Konversion (DABIK) - https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5255
