Better Noble Kids! (was: Connor isn't an Elf! Epilogue Fix)
Version: v1.0

File under: We Don't Need No Stinkin' QA! with a side of DarthParametric to the rescue
Author: theskymoves

=================
Requirements:
=================

Dragon Age: Origins
DarthParametric's Additional Clothing for Kids (Mod Resource) - http://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/4393/

=================
Description:
=================

Possessed!Connor's vanilla morph reflects his demonic passenger... he has bruised, discoloured skin, shadowed eyes, and dark lips. If he lives, and the Warden dies, Not!Possessed!Connor will attend the funeral... as an elf. The creature file for epilogue Connor does not use his Redcliffe morph, substituting instead the morph of an ambient elf boy from Nature of the Beast.

I've edited the original Bioware morph for epilogue!Connor, giving him a different skin texture and texture blend, and removing the heavy make-up he wears when possessed. And I've added the new, unique Connor morph to his epilogue creature file.

I've also added appropriate noble clothing to Connor, his possessed!Redcliffe iterations (real!Connor and the Fade!Connors), and he'll now wear apprentice robes in his epilogue appearance.

Likewise, wee Oren Cousland in the Human Noble origin arc will now wear tiny noble clothing, instead of the same thing the peasant children wear. (Awwww...)
