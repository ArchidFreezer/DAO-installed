
Overhauls the greenery of the game to have more seasonal variety.

Note that this mod is just a retexture, it doesn't change the weather or anything, it simply modifies the foliage based on my preferences.
Lothering, Redcliffe, Lake Calenhad docks and various random encounters are now more autumnal.
Brecilian forest and the Dalish elf origin are more springlike.
Other locations were retextured and made more vibrant to enhance what was already there.
Interior textures were not changed.
This mod only applies to the base game.*

The mod has every area separated into folders, so you can delete the ones you don't like.

---------

Installation:
Unzip and drop the folder into \Documents\Bioware\Dragon Age\packages\core\override

To uninstall, simply delete the mod folder.

Compatibility

The mod isn't compatible with any mod that changes nature and terrain textures for outdoor areas. The "Terrain and Nature" folder in the Unofficial Remaster mod will conflict with this one.

*This mod is only for the base game, but the tree bark texture edits are global, meaning that they show up in the DLCs as well. If you don't like it, you can delete the "Tree bark textures" folder from the mod before starting the DLCs.
