Allows player to wear Alistair's rose as an amulet.  To install unpack and drop into your mydocuments\dragonage\packages\override folder.  With console enabled type runscript add_alistair_rose.  I thought it would be sweet to be to actually use his gift.  I mean a rose kinda withers and dies....unless it's preserved in lyrium of course.

My thanks to Bioware for creating an awesome game.
