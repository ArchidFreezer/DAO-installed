This is an overhaul of Awakening's encounter system to be more like Origins'.  This means that encounters are a great deal more predictable, and if you want the details on exactly 
how things work, scroll down past the ****** ;)


Install in the override.  Best installed before leaving Vigil's Keep for the first time.  If you have already travelled the world map, you will revisit any random encounters you've 
	already cleared, once each (with the enemies already dead), but it should properly keep track after that.
If updating from a previous version, please completely remove the old folders first, rather than overwriting them, since several old files are now defunct. 

 
Smaller fixes: 
	The crow assassin in the "Burning Bridge" encounter now drops 20+ gold and a note, like he's supposed to (both were in his inventory already, but weren't set to "droppable").  
		Additionally, there will now be an alternate version of the note if the PC is an Orlesian Warden. 
	The Avvar encounter on the "forest" encounter table had a faulty plot check.
	There was one mercenary mixed in with the Avvar; he's been replaced with another Avvar. 
	There were 6 empty barrels in the pirate encounter that you could attempt to loot, they've been deactivated.
	Nathaniel & Lillith both had generic encounter checks on one table (rather than checks dependent on their respective plots), meaning you could encounter them twice (and in 	
		the case of Nathaniel, potentially losing any equipment you may have given him!)
	Travelling now removes plot items that are no longer needed.  If you wish to see what will be removed and when, scroll to the very bottom. 
	Rearranged all encounter tables so that all generic encounters occur on only one table each, preventing you from showing up to a map you've already cleared.  To make up 
		for the lack of encounters on the plains table, I've added more chances for randomized/repeating encounters.  
		I've also given priority to unique encounters on all tables, so you should only get the randomized/repeating encounters if no others are available. 
	Renamed all Awakening encounter tables, to prevent possible conflicts with the encounter tables from Origins & other DLCs. 


Known issues:
	Sometimes you will be unable to leave an encounter map. This seems to be caused by memory leak, so saving/reloading will sometimes fix it.  The potato computer I used for 
		testing	had it happen a LOT, so I wrote a script to continue travel: "runscript continue_travel"
	Sometimes choosing a travel destination on the world map will cause a blink, or a popup that says "travel is not possible".  Waiting a few seconds & trying again fixes it.  
		Again, this appears to happen mostly on older and/or heavily modded systems.

If your game is already showing signs of strain, I would recommend only installing the 'encounter fixes' folder, and instead just use the random encounters debug menu to look for fights. 
	(runscript zz_rxa_debug) 


Compatibility:
	Completely compatible with bugfix mods (at least, all the ones that I could find). 
	Mostly compatible with mods that alter areas and enemies (see below). 
	Not compatible with other mods that edit random encounter tables.  With the changes I've made to the encounter system, other mods simply will have no effect at all. 
	Not compatible with any other mods that change the following:
		gxa_module_travel.ncs
﻿		gxa_world_map.map
﻿		terrain_types_gxa.gda
		worldmaps_gxa.gda
﻿		lines 20036 & 30000(new) of m2da_base_gxa.gda
﻿		rxa130cr_crow_assassin.utc
﻿		rxa140ar.are
﻿		rxa150ar.are 
	   

*********************************************

global encounter chance - the game keeps track of how many times the PC has travelled via world map, and checks a table to see if that trip is eligible for an encounter.  
	The original trip counter only allowed encounters about 1 in every 3 trips, so I've changed it to be like Origins, which allowed encounters about 70% of the time. 

terrain - In Origins, the encounter pool for each journey on the world map is based on the terrain of the destination.  These weren't set in Awakening, so I assigned 
	terrain types for each map pin:
		"beach": Forlorn Cove
		"canyon": Knotwood Hills, Anselm's Reef
		"farm": Old Stark's Farm, Turnoble Estate
		"forest": Blackmarsh, Wending Wood
		"plains": Vigil's Keep, Amaranthine 

encounter tables - for each terrain type there are lists of potential encounters.  Nathaniel, Lilith, and Velanna are on all lists (since they're plot-dependent and can only occur once). 
	Other encounters:  
		"beach": pirates, randomized/repeating (roadside farm)
		"canyon": Dragonbrand, burning bridge, randomized/repeating (canyon road)
		"farm": randomized/repeating (roadside farm)
		"forest": Avvar, randomized/repeating (forest path)
		"plains": randomized/repeating (forest path), randomized/repeating (canyon road), randomized/repeating (roadside farm)
	The "randomized/repeating" encounters are a special type of encounter, where the enemies are random, and spawned via script.
	The game chooses which encounter to run by literally running down the list first -> last, checking encounter chance and plot flag requirements.  If no encounters meet their 
	requirements, you get no encounter for that trip. 

	So, the best way to trigger the Dragonbrand encounter, for instance, is to travel back and forth between Knotwood Hills and Anselm's Reef (once you've met the plot requirements, 
		of course).

individual encounter chances & plot requirements-  The randomized/repeating maps have a 20% of chance of triggering when travelling to "plains", 30% when travelling anywhere else.  
	Nathaniel, Velanna, & Lillith are guaranteed triggers once their plot conditions have been met. The other unique encounters are guaranteed to trigger once you've completed at 
	least one major plot, except the Dragonbrand encounter, which requires you to have completed two major plots.
