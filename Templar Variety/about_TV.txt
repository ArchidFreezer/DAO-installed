Ports of medium templar armors from DAI, and a collection of edits to diversify the templars.  
Install in the override folder.  If you have floating heads, the likely cause is a GDA conflict, or missing meshes. 

Several character files (UTCs) have been edited - mostly one-off, background characters.  For characters with multiple instances (largely enemies), scripting was used instead. 
The UTC edits will likely conflict with mods that change the default templar massive armor.  You'll have to decide which mod's edits you prefer. 

Human-only.  If you want a set of each for yourself, use 'runscript give_templar'.  The stats are the same as the default steel templar armor, but without attribute requirements.  
(+3 willpower, +20% spell resistance, +5 mental resistance on the chestpiece; nothing on the other pieces)
